# About me

I am currently an AI Research Resident under the supervision of [Dr. Hy Truong Son](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hytruongson/) at [FPT Software AI Center](https://www.fpt-aicenter.com/). I holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligience at the School of Information and Communication Technology (SOICT), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam. My research interests include natural language processing, operations research, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation. 

Prior to his current position, I worked as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/) at the Modelling, Simulation, and Optimization Laboratory (MSO Lab), SOICT, HUST, and I published several papers in prestigious journals and conferences, such as Memetic Computing, Applied Intelligence, and Congress on Evolutionary Computation.
