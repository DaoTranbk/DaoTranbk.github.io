# Biography

Hi there, welcome to my personal page! 

I am currently an AI Research Resident under the supervision of [Dr. Hy Truong Son](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hytruongson/) at [FPT Software AI Center](https://www.fpt-aicenter.com/), Vietnam. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence under the supervision of [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/) at the [School of Information and Communication Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/) (SOICT), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) (HUST), Vietnam. My research interests include natural language processing, operations research, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation. 

Prior to my current position, I worked as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/) at the [Modelling, Simulation, and Optimization Laboratory](http://mso.soict.hust.edu.vn/) (MSO Lab), SOICT, HUST, and I published several papers in prestigious journals and conferences, such as Memetic Computing, Applied Intelligence, Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, and Congress on Evolutionary Computation.
